# Create-Meetups
Created single-page web form where the user can create meetups and the client will store the meetups so that if page is refreshed the meetups are still stored. Main goal of the project was to gain familiarity with the MEAN framework.

Done using Michael Moser's instructional video on MEAN Stack.
